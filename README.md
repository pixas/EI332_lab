My three labs in 2020-2021 EI332 

## How to Use
You can refer but not copy because once your behaviour has been identified, you will lose many points. And considering the final exams are difficult and hard to get a good mark, mark of lab is quit important.

## How to Avoid Plagiarism
You can follow the instructions and reports in each lab. Also, you can follow the annotations in each files to change your variable names and so on.

## My Experience
If your lab teacher is CYQ, it is probably that she teaches nothing about verilog but some pdf reference. Some students are quite smart and they have experience concerning CPU design. I recommend that general students focus on making the sense of principles in one-single and pipelined cpu, code related problems are not so significant.

## Lab Introduce
- Single Cycle CPU
- Single Cycle CPU with I/O ports
- pipelined CPU with I/O ports

## Lab Exams
There are three problems
1. change the display ports; input two 8-bit binary number and output the first digit of their concatenation that is 1. E.g. 00111100;;10110001 -> 3
2. change the display ports; output the final digits of your school number (the hardest)
3. change the display ports; output the Hamming weights (the easiest)
